# Egg Interpreter ü•öüê£

Egg is a minimalist, whimsical programming language inspired by eggs and birds ‚Äî designed to be simple, fun, and easy to extend. It uses playful keywords like `yolk`, `shellmatch`, `carton`, and `hatch` to create a unique coding experience.

---

## Features

- **Variables** with `yolk` (assignment)
- **Pattern matching** with `shellmatch` / `case` / `default`
- **Arrays** called `carton`
- **Control flow** with simple conditional blocks
- **Functions** definition and calls with `crackup` and `lay`
- **Built-in utilities** (`random()`, `eggtime()`, `len()`, `type()`)
- **File inclusion** with `incubate filename.egg`
- Simple **output** via `hatch`

---

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Node.js (for the CLI and VSCode extension)
- VS Code (to use the extension)

---
## Run Egg Code

- Install the Egg CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g egglang-cli
```
Then run any .egg file:

```bash
egg run dino.egg
```

---

## Egg Language Syntax Examples
### Variable Assignment

```bash
yolk x = 5
yolk greeting = "hello"
```

### Pattern Matching
```bash
yolk action = "crack"

shellmatch action
  case "crack":
    hatch "Breaking stuff"
  case "hatch":
    hatch "Output detected"
  default:
    hatch "Unknown behavior"
endshell
```

### Arrays (carton)
```bash
carton nest 3
fill nest at 0 with 10
hatch nest at 0  # outputs: 10
```

## Functions

### Define a function:

```bash
crackup say_hello
  hatch "Hello from Egg!"
lay
```

### Call a function:

```bash
crackup say_hello
```

### Built-in Functions
- random(a, b) ‚Äî random int between a and b

- eggtime() ‚Äî current timestamp string

- len(x) ‚Äî length of string or list

- type(x) ‚Äî type name of value

## File Inclusion
- Use incubate filename.egg to include and run another Egg file.

### How It Works (Under the Hood)
- The interpreter parses and executes Egg code line-by-line.

- Variables are stored in environments (yolk assigns values).

- Arrays (carton) support indexed access and mutation.

- Pattern matching uses shellmatch blocks.

- Functions are defined as named code blocks and called with crackup.

- Built-in EggTools functions extend language capabilities.

- Simple error handling prints fragile: messages.

## Example: Complete Egg Script
```bash

incubate utils.egg

yolk action = "crack"
shellmatch action
  case "crack":
    hatch "Breaking stuff"
  case "hatch":
    hatch "Output detected"
  default:
    hatch "Unknown behavior"
endshell

carton nest 3
fill nest at 0 with 10
hatch nest at 0

yolk r = random(1,10)
hatch r

yolk t = eggtime()
hatch t
```

## Easter Egg - ü•ö Eggspionage: Terminal Cam in ASCII

```bash
eggspionage
```
By default, the terminal cam will render in base black text mode.
Here -c refers to color mode. Use one of r, g, b, m, d. r=red, g=green, b=blue, m=multicolor, d=dino mode.

Example:

```bash
eggspionage -c g
```

### Features:
- üì∏ Live webcam feed rendered in ASCII

- üåà Optional color mode

- ‚å®Ô∏è Cross-platform compatibility (macOS, Linux, Windows)

- üß† Automatically scales to your terminal size

- ‚úÇÔ∏è Gracefully exits on Ctrl+C
